K nearest neighbors is a machine learning algorithm that classifies cases based on a similarity measure known as distance functions. 
This algorithm can also be used for regressionâ€Š,output is the value for the object.
This value is the average or median of the values of its k nearest neighbors.
KNN is used in statistical estimation and pattern recognition.
The cancer patients can be classified based on their health parameters and we can also predict whether there is a chance for a patient to have cancer.
Using KNN algorithm,cancer patients are classified by a majority vote of its neighbours(parameter distance), with the value being assigned to the class most common among its k nearest neighbors.
This algorithm is implemented in mapreduce,because of its ability to store as well as distribute large data sets across plenty of servers.
